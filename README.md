Here I am working on Face recognition based Attendance Management System by using OpenCV(Python). One can mark thier attendance by simply facing the camera.

It works as follows:

When we run python manage.py runserver command a window is opened and it shows 3 tabs as present, absent and history. After this there are two more buttons named as profiles and run scanner.By clicking Run scanner button camera will start and it will recognize people.But first we have to add atleast one profile in profiles.In profiles we can see profiles of people that we have added and also we have add profile option their where we can add more profiles. Press Q(or q) to quit this scanner.After quitting it attendance of person will be stored in present tab. And we can see profile of that person . Still that person is not recognised in scanner then that person will be marked absent in absent tab. In history tab, we can see names of all people who are recognised. 

Thanks.
